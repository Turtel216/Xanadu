#### A simple interpreted esoteric programming language with syntax based on Rush song lyrics and titles

> [!WARNING]
> The language is still under development and will probably undergo several changes before release. Keywords are most likely to change in the future

## Syntax

Xanadu is a dynamically typed language. Each statement has to end with semicolone **;**

### Variables

The **yyz** keyword is used for declaring variables.

```ruby
yyz name = "Xanadu";
```

### Writting to the console

To write to the console use the **blabla** keyword 

```ruby
blabla "Piece";
```

### Control flow

**while** loops are declared using the **workingmans_grind** keyword 

```ruby
workingmans_grind(true) {
   blabla "Rush rocks!";
}
```

**for** loops are declared using the **circumstances** keyword 

```ruby
circumstances()
```

**if** statements are declared using the **freewill** keyword

```ruby
freewill(1 == 1) {
    blabla "I will choose free will";
}
```

**else** statements are declaed using the **counterpoint** keyword 

```ruby
freewill(1 == 2) {
   blabla "I will choose free will";
} counterpoint {
   blabla "You still made a choice";
}
```

### Functions

Functions are declared using the **subdivision** keyword 

```ruby
subdivision add(a, b) {
   limelight a + b
}
```

The **limelight** keyword in the above example functions just as a **return** keyword in other languages

### Classes

Classes in Xanadu are declared using the **overtune** keyword

```ruby
overtune Band
{

}
```
