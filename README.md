        yyz name = "Xanadu";

To write to the console use the **blabla** keyword 

        blabla "Piece"

### Control flow

**while** loops are declared using the **Workingmans_grind** keyword 

        Workingmans_grind(true) {
            blabla "Rush rocks!"
        }

**for** loops are declared using the **circumstances** keyword 

        circumstances()

**if** statements are declared using the **Freewill** keyword

        Freewill(1 == 1) {
